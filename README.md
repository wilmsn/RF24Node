# RF24Node

RF24Node - Nodes for my RF24 Network.

What do you need to start with it? Basicly 3 things: 
- An AVR based node with any sensor attached (this project)
- A gateway that connects the RF24 Network with your LAN (can be an ESP-Node with active RF24Gateway or a Raspberry PI)
- The RF24Hub as the backend with the logic inside (see project RF24Hub)

About RF24Node: 
- designed to work with a minimum of components
- designed to be battery friendly (runs about 2 years on 2 AA Batteries)

The rest of this documentation is in german!
